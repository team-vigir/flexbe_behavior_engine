------------------
* Merge pull request `#132 <https://github.com/team-vigir/flexbe_behavior_engine/issues/132>`_ from LoyVanBeek/feature/test_require_launch_file_success
  Optionally fail test if launch-file fails
* Clear up logging for exiting processes
* Check all launched nodes have exited
  And check they exit code to decide success/fail of launch file
