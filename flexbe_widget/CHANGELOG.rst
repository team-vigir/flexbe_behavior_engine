1.2.5 (2020-06-14)
------------------
* Merge pull request `#120 <https://github.com/team-vigir/flexbe_behavior_engine/issues/120>`_ from cheffe112/startup_race_condition
  wait for READY status from Behavior Engine before launching behavior to avoid race conditions on startup
* avoid callback trigger before ready event has been created
* Merge pull request `#113 <https://github.com/team-vigir/flexbe_behavior_engine/issues/113>`_ from team-vigir/feature/state_logger_rework
  State Logger Rework
* Merge branch 'develop' into feature/state_logger_rework
* wait for READY status from Behavior Engine before launching behavior
  Whenever behavior_onboard and be_launcher are launched together, there used to be a race condition of publishing the behavior in behavior_launcher, but the subscriber in behavior_onboard not being ready yet. Hence, behavior_launcher now waits for the READY status to appear on the flexbe/status topic before it actually attempts to launch the behavior.
* [flexbe_widget] Update evaluate_logs script to new format
* Merge pull request `#118 <https://github.com/team-vigir/flexbe_behavior_engine/issues/118>`_ from StefanFabian/action_server_callback_based
  Using event based action server instead of control loop.
* Improved preempt logic.
* Only accept goal if ActionServer is not active.
* Handle errors before behavior start.
* Using event based action server instead of control loop.
  Waiting for terminal state of flexbe before setting goal to a terminal state and accepting a new one.
